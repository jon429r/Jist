## Introduction

Jist is built using **Rust**, taking advantage of its safety and performance. With a focus on minimalism, Jist is suited for both small scripting tasks and larger, more complex applications. Rust's ownership system ensures memory safety, and Jist inherits these properties, making it a secure and performant language.

### Key Features:
- Simple and expressive syntax
- Safe and fast, leveraging Rust's ownership model
- Flexible typing system with both static and dynamic capabilities
- Built-in concurrency support using Rust's async features
- Cross-platform support, compiling to efficient binaries

## Installation

**Requirements:**
- [Jist Compiler (JistR)](https://example.com/download)
- [Rust toolchain](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [Standard Library](https://example.com/stdlib)

```bash
# Install the Jist compiler (requires Rust installed)
!! Not Implemented please clone repo to use !!
After Cloning run cargo build --release
sudo mv target/release/jist /usr/local/bin/

$ cargo install jistc
```
Alternatively, you can download pre-built binaries from the [releases page](https://example.com/releases).

## Syntax Overview

### Hello World
```jist
echo("Hello, World!")
```
### Variables
```jist
//Copy code
let name: string = "Jist"
let version: float = 1.0
```
### Comments
```jist
//Copy code
// This is a single-line comment

/* 
   This is a 
   multi-line comment 
*/
```
### Data Types

Jist supports both primitive and complex data types:

Primitive Types:
Integer
Float
String
Boolean
Complex Types:
Arrays
Hashmaps
Custom Structs
```jist
//Copy code
let age: int = 25        // Integer
let pi: float = 3.14       // Float
let greeting: string = "Hi" // String
let firstInital: char = 'J' // Char, notice singe quotes for chars and double quotes for strings 
let isValid: boolean = true  // Boolean
```
### Control Structures

If-Else
```jist
Copy code
if (condition) {
    // do something
} else {
    // do something else
}
```
Loops
```jist
//Copy code
for (i in 0..10) {
    echo(i)
}

while (condition) {
    // do something
```
### Functions

```jist
//Copy code
func add(a: Integer, b: Integer) -> Integer {
    return a + b;
```
### Error Handling

Jist uses try-catch blocks for error handling, inspired by Rustâ€™s result and error types.

```jist
//Copy code
try {
    // code that may fail
} catch error {
    // handle error
```
### Examples

```jist
Copy code
func factorial(n: Integer) -> Integer {
    if n <= 1 {
        return 1
    }
    return n * factorial(n - 1)
```
